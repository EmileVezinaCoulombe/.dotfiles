# Welcome to my dotfiles

## Getting started

### Dotfiles

To install the dotfiles run ```bash . ./install.sh ```

To select the dotfiles you want, just modify the `STOW_FOLDER` variable.

### Apps

To setup all apps run ```bash . ./install-all.sh ```

Note that the script `install-all.sh` is only tested on my system running *Pop!_OS*.
It's a personal project and should be treated accordingly.
I offer absolutely no guarantee.

That said I hope you enjoy and copy some bits, but please site me, it would be nice!
